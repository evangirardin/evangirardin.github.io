      <h2 class="subtitle">A guide by Evan Girardin (<span class="smaller">evaluat</span>ED), <img class="mathnews" src="assets/logo.svg" alt="mathNEWS"> Editor</h2><img class="flavor" src="assets/spread.jpg">
      <p><img class="mathnews" src="assets/logo.svg" alt="mathNEWS">&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the student paper of the Math Faculty at Waterloo, containing little math and even less news&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;is broadly regarded as the Most Important University Publication Ever. You might&#8217;ve seen copies littered around campus, lining garbage cans, or whatever else people do with it. Maybe you&#8217;ve even <a href="https://mathnews.uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">read it!</a> As the person reading <em>this,</em> however, the mass dissemination of this long-beloved rag now weighs squarely on your shoulders. But, don&#8217;t worry! Soon, you&#8217;ll be slinging issues across campus in no time.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Recommended resources: </em></strong>a friend to help! You&#8217;ll be carting some heavy stuff around, so bring a friend to hold doors open and help with counting issues. You might break your back otherwise!</p>
      <p><strong><em>Required resources: </em></strong>know your way around campus! At least know where most of the major buildings are, or know how to avail of a map.</p>

        <li>Any time before 4:30 PM on Thursday, make your way to W&nbsp;Print in the General Services Complex (GSC) on campus. They don&#8217;t make their whereabouts obvious&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;if you&#8217;re crossing Ring Road from the ION tracks, hang a right and then take the left into the weird alleyway. There should be a door with a big W&nbsp;Print logo on it.
          <figure><img src="assets/wprint.png" style="max-width: 20em; margin: auto;">
            <figcaption>Here it is.</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>Head inside and let them know you&#8217;re here for the <img class="mathnews" src="assets/logo.svg" alt="mathNEWS"> order. They&#8217;ll take a few minutes, but you’ll eventually be given a small hand truck carrying 3&ndash;4 boxes of <img class="mathnews" src="assets/logo.svg" alt="mathNEWS"> issues.</li>
        <li>Make your way to the <img class="mathnews" src="assets/logo.svg" alt="mathNEWS"> office with the hand truck. You can take any route you want, but the Editor Certified&trade; way is to head across William Tutte Way, into DC, up a floor through the elevator, across the MC-DC bridge, down the open hallway shortly ahead and on your left, and into MC 3030.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="predistribution">Pre-distribution <a href="#predistribution">#</a></h2><img class="flavor" src="assets/mainpc.jpg">
      <p>So, you&#8217;ve got all of this week&#8217;s <img class="mathnews" src="assets/logo.svg" alt="mathNEWS"> issues in the office. What a privilege! All that&#8217;s left is to bring it to the stands and be done, right? <b>No! </b>There are some important numbers you need to run and record beforehand, and things to wrap up after.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In the office, log into the main computer (closest to the door). The editor will have told you the password if needed.</li>
        <li>Open up Firefox, type &#8220;distribution numbers&#8221; in the search bar, and click the first Google Sheets link that gets suggested. You should end up in a spreadsheet called, well, &#8220;Distribution Numbers&#8221;.</li>
        <li>If it&#8217;s not already open, switch to the tab for the current volume (e.g. v152 in Spring 2023) by clicking the appropriate tab at the bottom of the screen.</li>
        <li>Decide how many issues to put on each stand! These numbers should sum to <strong>650</strong> (the total number of issues), and should be recorded in the &#8220;Distributed&#8221; column. We have 8 stands for <img class="mathnews" src="assets/logo.svg" alt="mathNEWS">.
          <ul>
            <li>Check the per-stand numbers for the last issue&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;if you think you&#8217;ve seen some leftover issues on one of the stands, consider reallocating some issues from that stand to a more popular one. If you aren&#8217;t sure, just keep the numbers the same.</li>
            <li>The recorded amount for &#8220;Mail + to keep&#8221; should be 30. These issues won&#8217;t go on a stand; they&#8217;ll be dealt with separately later.</li>
            <li class="warning"><strong><em>Warning: </em></strong>The &#8220;Total&#8221; cell will be calculated automatically, so don’t type in it!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Copy these numbers onto a sticky note; you&#8217;ll need to bring them with you later.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions and Archival <a href="#subscriptions">#</a></h2><img class="flavor" src="assets/cabinets.jpg">
      <p>So, you&#8217;ve got all of this week&#8217;s <img class="mathnews" src="assets/logo.svg" alt="mathNEWS"> issues in the office, <em>and </em>you&#8217;ve run the distribution numbers. Is it time to distribute yet? <strong>No, certainly not! </strong>There&#8217;s one last extra-important step, and we want to put off distribution as long as possible so that it comes out on stands late&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;we want most people to pick it up on Friday morning, after all, rather than Thursday evening!</p>
      <p>In any case, some people pay for termly subscriptions to have <img class="mathnews" src="assets/logo.svg" alt="mathNEWS"> mailed to them regularly, and this sacred bond is yours to honor. If you need a pair of scissors, a pen, or a marker later on, there should be at least one of each in the Pirouline&#174; tin on the desk.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In the search bar of Firefox, type in &#8220;subscriptions&#8221; and click the first suggested Google Sheets link. You should end up in a spreadsheet called&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you guessed it&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;&#8220;Subscriptions&#8221;.</li>
        <li>Switch to the <strong>internal </strong>tab. This has a list of each on-campus subscription. Count how many subscriptions there are and keep that number in your head.</li>
        <li>From the bottom-rightmost drawer of the secondary computer (the one you&#8217;re not using), take a number of envelopes equal to the number you counted; sit back down at the main computer and set the envelopes down in front of you.</li>
        <li>Crack open the topmost box of <img class="mathnews" src="assets/logo.svg" alt="mathNEWS"> issues, and take out 30 issues for mail. Set them down next to the envelopes.</li>
        <li>For each line in the spreadsheet, slot the indicated number of copies from that pile into an envelope, and write the specified name and department/building/room number on the front of the envelope, in order. Seal each envelope shut and stamp each in the top-left corner with the <img class="mathnews" src="assets/logo.svg" alt="mathNEWS"> stamp (this should be sitting on the right half of the desk). Set them all in a pile for later.
          <ul>
            <li class="warning"><strong><em>Important: </em></strong>the first envelope&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;&#8220;Red Book Mints&#8221;&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;is for our own archives and shouldn&#8217;t be sent out. Once sealed, file it away in the drawer labelled &#8220;v148&ndash;&#8221; in the big array of filing cabinets.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Now, switch to the <strong>external </strong>tab. Again, count how many subscriptions there are and remember that number.</li>
        <li>From the cardboard box on top of the big array of filing cabinets, take a number of envelopes equal to the number you counted, sit back down at the main computer, and set the envelopes down in front of you.</li>
        <li>Do the same thing as earlier: for each line in the spreadsheet, slot the indicated number of copies from the pile into an envelope, write the full address front-and-center on the envelope, stamp the top-left, and seal it.
          <ul>
            <li class="warning"><strong><em>Important: </em></strong>the &#8220;Legal Deposit&#8221; one is <em>really </em>important, so make sure to get the address right! We are required, by law, to send 2 copies of each issue to the National Archives.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Once that&#8217;s all done, take all of the sealed envelopes to the MathSoc office (MC 3038) and place them on the big black rack at the front desk to be mailed out.</li>
        <li>You&#8217;re not done yet&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;head back to the <img class="mathnews" src="assets/logo.svg" alt="mathNEWS"> office!</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="distribution">Distribution <a href="#distribution">#</a></h2><img class="flavor" src="assets/stands2.png">
      <p>So, you&#8217;ve got all of this week&#8217;s <img class="mathnews" src="assets/logo.svg" alt="mathNEWS"> issues in the office, you&#8217;ve run the distribution numbers, <strong><em>and </em></strong>you&#8217;ve finished the subscriptions. Now&#8217;s your time to become the great invisible hand that causes <img class="mathnews" src="assets/logo.svg" alt="mathNEWS"> to magically materialize across campus (and also causes math students to not pay attention in their morning lectures tomorrow).</p>
      <p>This stage is where bringing a friend will help speed things along, so drag someone along with you if you can! Here&#8217;s a set of maps with the locations of our stands highlighted:</p>

          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>
      <ol>
        <li>Grab the sticky note from earlier, take the hand truck with the issues, and leave the office, closing the door behind you.</li>
        <li>Head to each of our stands and set the recorded number of copies on each, taking the hand truck of issues with you.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Since you have the hand truck, you&#8217;ll need to take routes with elevators.</li>
          <li>Crack open boxes as needed, and if a stand has two levels, use the lower one as overflow when you can&#8217;t fit any more on the top level.</li>
          <li>When you finish a stand, take the top issue on the stand and slot it into the vertical display tray, if the stand has one. The only stands which <strong><em>don&#8217;t</em></strong> have one are <strong>DC, MC 4th floor, and MC 2nd floor.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Finally, once all the issues have been distributed, bring the hand truck back to the W&nbsp;Print office where you got it.</li>
        <li>Bask in the knowledge that <strong><em>you</em></strong> were squarely responsible for putting the Most Important University Publication Ever on stands today. When you see people reading it between classes tomorrow, that&#8217;s your handiwork!</li>
